      One of my favourite things of all time is passing computer science 10. It
      would really bring me joy to pass my favourite class of all time. Look at
      how happy that guy in the photo is. He would love me to pass computer
      science 10, just sayin'.

      Yeah I'm pretty lucky to have such a great friend group. I don't know what
      I'd do without them (probably nothing). Couldn't find an image that links
      to this, so here's a photo of a cute dog.
